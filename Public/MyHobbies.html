            <h2>To code</h2>
            <p>Yeah, laugh it up! I know this website is a little bit simple, but what can I do? I'm learning and getting better and better. I've been loving to study how websites and other innovative technologies work. If you want, here are my latest simple projects.</p>

            <h2>To study English</h2>
            <p>I've been studying English for about a year, and I can say that I love this language — it's so fluid and simple. I'm quite excited to use this achievement in my life and future work. I'll never stop dedicating my time and effort to it.</p>

            <h2>To Play guitar</h2>
            <p>I started playing two years ago, just one day after the turning point of my life. In those moments of reflection, you feel a fire inside your heart calling out to you: 'You need to let it out.' And I did.</p>

        <li>
            <h2>To Exercise</h2>
            <p>There isn’t anything better than going to the gym and feeling your body come alive. I can't explain exactly why I feel this way, but while some people are lost in their smorgasbord of drugs and bad habits, I'm satisfied with the way my life and health is.</p>
